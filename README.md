# ARTS-Autonomically-Reinforced-Traffic-System
Undergrad final year (2020) capstone project dedicated to solving traffic problems in India by transforming the current static and schedule-based traffic system into a dynamic one. I developed the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm that takes number of vehicles as inputs and outputs a relevant green light signal timing maintaining the current signal sequence
